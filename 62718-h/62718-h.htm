<h3 id="c2">Tricks of the trade:</h3>
<h4>BASIC DIRECTIONS</h4>
<p><i>Step 1:</i> Remove cross bar from bottom of
hairpin lace loom. Loom is held with round
end up (or remaining bar up if adjustable
loom). Form a slip loop &frac12; the width of loom,
place left prong through loop (illustration #1),
replace cross bar.</p>
<p><i>Step 2:</i> Pass yarn around right side of loom
and across back ([illustration #2]), insert
crochet hook in loop and pull until knot is at
center, pick up yarn and pull through loop
(illustration #3), remove hook from loop.</p>
<p><i>Step 3:</i> Insert hook in dropped loop from
back (illustration #4) turn loom toward
you from right to left, passing yarn around
back of loom, chain 1 (illustration #5) sc
in front loop to left of center sts, (illustration #6)
drop loop from hook.</p>
<p>(Note: If easier for you, do not drop hook
from loop before turning, but pass shank of
crochet hook through to back of loom and
then turn and proceed as in step 3 after turn.)</p>

<p class="pcap">STEP 1 &middot; STEP 2 &middot; STEP 3 &middot; STEP 4 &middot; STEP 5 &middot; STEP 6</p>
</div>
<p>KEEPING TWIST: To keep twist in loops,
insert crochet hook from back to front in
loops, then follow directions given.</p>
<p>WORKING LOOPS STRAIGHT: Insert
crochet hook from front to back in loops,
then follow directions given.</p>
<h4>PREVENTING SLANT:</h4>
<p>When joining strips they sometimes have a
tendency to ride uphill or to one side. We
therefore suggest the following method of
joining. Alternating from strip to strip, with
starting end always on the right, insert hook
in 2 right loops of 1st strip and pull through
1st 2 left loops of 2nd strip, then 2 loops on
1st strip, etc. until all loops are joined. Fasten
off.</p>
<p>Insert crochet hook in 2 left loops of 3rd
strip, pull 2 right loops of 2nd strip through,
etc.</p>
<p>Insert hook in 2 right loops of 3rd strip, pull
through 2 left loops of 4th strip, then 2 loops
of 3rd strip, etc.</p>
<p>Insert hook in 2 left loops of 5th strip, pull
through 2 right loops of 4th strip, then 2
loops of 5th strip. Finish all last loops by
pulling remaining length at center of strip
through last loop, bring end back to center
and work back through several sts at center.
Conceal all ends.</p>
<p>COUNTING LOOPS: There must always
be same number of loops on EACH side of
loom. When a large number of loops are required
use a SUSAN BATES&#174; marker to
mark the 50th or the 100th loop on each
side, then count from marker. This will be a
time saver.</p>
<p>FULL LOOM: Remove cross bar, slip all
but 3 or 4 loops off loom. Replace bar and
roll loops up; secure with SUSAN BATES&#174;
4&frac12; inch stitch holder to back of work to
prevent stretching of loops while continuing
strip.</p>
<p>GAUGE: Measure the stitches at center of
loom; if you get more stitches than called
for, change to a larger crochet hook; if you
get less stitches than called for, change to a
smaller hook.</p>

<p>Yarn is used double. Each loop has two
strands of yarn but is still called a single
loop.</p>
<p>Edgings on both afghan and pillow are
made on a 3-inch loom, even though the
afghan is made on a 4-inch.</p>
<p>AFGHAN: With 4-inch loom and J-10 crochet
hook, make strips of 130 lps each on
each side of loom as follows: 6-purple, 7-blue,
12-white.</p>
<p>To join: Starting with blue strip, join to
white strip (as per instructions below), then
join to purple strip, then to white ... continue
thus for length of afghan, ending with
blue strip.</p>
<p>Join loops by pulling 2 lps through 2 lps,
always starting at the same end. When all
strips are joined, weave in all ends, and finish
as follows. Finish sides of afghan by
pulling 2 lps through 2 lps. Fasten last 2
lps securely. Attach double yarn at corner,
and working along ends, sc in corner, * ch
2, sc in next lp. Repeat from * across, ending
ch 2, sc in corner st. Ch 1, turn.</p>
<p>ROW 2: Sc in first st. Then work * 2 sc in
ch 2 space, sc in next sc. Repeat from *
across. Fasten off. Work other end of afghan
the same way.</p>
<p>EDGING: With purple yarn and 3-inch
crochet loom, and working on one side of
loom, make 2 strips each of 200 lps, and 2
each of 150 lps.</p>
<p>To Make Edging: Edging is worked in the
same way as regular strips, but instead of
working the single crochet down the center
of the loom, it is worked close to one prong.
This will make the loops on one side of
strip longer than the other. With J-10 crochet
hook, and working on smallest loops,
pull 2 lps through 2 lps all the way across
each strip. If you prefer, the long loop may
be cut for a fringe effect.</p>
<p>Sew the longer strips to the sides, and
the shorter ones to the ends, easing them
around the corners, keeping them flat.</p>
<h3 id="c6">PILLOW:</h3>
<p>Make 18 strips each of 42 lps each side as
follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">6&mdash;blue</p>
<p class="t0">4&mdash;purple</p>
<p class="t0">8&mdash;white</p>
</div>
<p>Join by pulling 2 lps through 2 lps as follows:
Starting with blue strip continue with
white, purple, white, blue, white, purple,
white, blue, blue, white, purple, white,
blue, white, purple, white, blue. When all
strips have been joined, join the first strip
to the last. Weave in all ends. Slip pillow
form in and sew both ends.</p>
<p>EDGING: With purple yarn and 3-inch
crochet loom and working on one side of
loom, make a strip of approximately 200 lps,
or enough to go around pillow. Finish short
loops by pulling 2 lps through 2 lps, and sew
to pillow.</p>

<p>Gauge: 3 sc = 1 inch at center of strip.</p>
<p>Yarn is used double. Each loop has two
strands of yarn but is still called a single
loop.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>TAM: Make hairpin lace strips as follows:</dt>
<dd class="t2">1 strip of 30 loops</dd>
<dd class="t2">2 strips of 60 loops</dd>
<dd class="t2">2 strips of 90 loops</dd></dl>
<p>FIRST STRIP (30 lps): Thread a piece of
yarn through all loops on one side of strip
and tie yarn tightly forming a circle. Attach
ends at center of strip together. Attach second
strip (60 lps) by pulling 2 lps of second
strip through 1 lp of first strip with crochet
hook, 1 lp of first through 2 lps of second,
until all loops are joined. Fasten end, and
sew center ends of strip together. Starting
each strip in a different place, join 3rd strip
(90 lps) by pulling 2 lps of second strip
through 3 lps of third, and 3 lps of third
through 2 lps of second, all around. Fasten.
Join fourth strip (90 lps) by pulling 3 lps
through 3 lps, all around. Fasten. Join 5th
strip (60 lps) by pulling 3 lps of fourth
through 2 lps of fifth, and 2 lps of fifth
through 3 lps of the fourth, all around. Fasten.</p>
<p>To finish last strip, pull 2 lps through 2 lps
all around. Fasten off. With J-10 crochet
hook and yarn used double, work around
edge of tam as follows: Work 45 sc around.
Join with a slip stitch. Work two more rows
of single crochet, stitch for stitch. Fasten off.
Make a large pom-pon with a Susan Bates or
Marcia Lynn pom-pon maker and attach to
top of tam.</p>
<p>SCARF: Make 4 strips each of 150 loops.
Lay two strips side by side on a table. Keep
in mind that each loop has two strands of
yarn but is still called a single loop. Put crochet
hook through first 2 lps on first strip.
Now put hook through first 2 lps on second
strip and pull them through the 2 lps already
on hook. With these 2 lps still on hook,
pick up the next 2 lps on first strip and pull
them through. Continue in this manner,
alternating first and second strips, until all
loops have been worked. Fasten off as shown
in basic directions. Join 3rd to 2nd and 4th
to 3rd strip in same manner as above. Finish
outside edges by pulling 2 lps through 2 lps
all the way to the top.</p>
<p>TO MAKE FRINGE. Wrap yarn around
a six-inch cardboard 96 times. Cut at one
end. Each piece should measure 12 inches.
Take 6 strands and fold them in half. Pull
folded end through work with crochet hook,
drawing it through about 2 inches. Then
pull the 12 loose ends through this loop, and
pull until knot is formed. Space them&mdash;2 at
each end of each strip, making 8 at each end.
Scarf may be made wider by adding more
strips.</p>

<p>Working tightly, work 30 s c around first
bone ring and join with a sl st. Without
breaking yarn, work 15 s c in next ring (to
cover half) and continue to work 15 s c in
each ring until 19 rings are joined. Work 30
s c in last ring (20th), and then working
down the other side, work 15 s c in each ring
(to cover other half) until all rings have
been covered. Weave in end of yarn. Slip
ribbon in and out of each ring, leaving end

or subtracting rings in multiples of two.
Always use an even number of rings.</p>
<h3 id="c28">Covered Buttons</h3>
<p>When making covered buttons, always use
the smallest crochet hook possible for the
yarn you are using. Work should be firm to
make a neat button. Also, the cover should
be a very tight fit. Lay yarn on table and
make a double loop. Pick loops up, and
insert crochet hook, and bring through a

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
